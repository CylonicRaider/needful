# needful

The pinnacle of UI.

## Usage

- **Development server:** Run `npm run dev`, and go to <http://localhost:4200>.
- **Testing:** Run `npm run test` to (continuously) perform unit tests.
- **Code clean-up:** Run `npm run cleanup` to invoke the code formatter and
  linter. They are also available individually as `npm run format` and
  `npm run lint`.

### Deployment

- **Build:** Run `npm run build` to put production-ready server and client
  images into the `dist/` directory.
  - `dist/public` contains the client files, and can be deployed to a static
    file server or CDN.
  - `dist/server` contains the server at `dist/server/main.js`. The server
    requires the client files for server-side rendering; if installed at a
    non-default location, you need to specify the client directory's path as the
    `--webroot`.
- **Run:** Run `npm start` (after a successful build) to start the production
  server at the default port.
